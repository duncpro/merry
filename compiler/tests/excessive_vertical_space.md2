   That's nothing new
   // In this case, the double break should not raise an ExcessiveVerticalSpaceWarning
   // because a double break is *the only way* to achieve this behavior. Since,
   // a single break would simply extend the previous inner block, which is not what
   // we want. We want a **second** nested block here. Two consecutive nested blocks.

   // Despite being the same indent level as the list element above, 
   // this is a actually not a part of that list element's block. 
   // This is because there is not a single break, but a double break after the
   // list element.
   //
   // So this instead gets interpreted as a nested block in the root.
