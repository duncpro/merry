From time to time [people]{1,2} suggest to me that [scientists]{ ,   } ought to give more
consideration to social problems, especially that they should be more responsible 
in considering the impact of science on society. It seems to be generally believed that 
if the scientists would only look at these very difficult social problems and not spend so 
much time fooling with less vital scientific ones, great success would come of it.

*It seems to me*{a} that we do think about these problems from time to time, but we don’t
put a _fulltime effort_ into them, the ~reasons~ being that we know we don’t have any magic
formula for solving social problems, that social problems are very much harder than scientific
ones, and that we usually don’t get anywhere when we do think about them.
