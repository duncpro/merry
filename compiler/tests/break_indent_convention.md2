From time to time people suggest to me that scientists ought to give more
consideration to social problems – especially that they should be more responsible 
in considering the impact of science on society. It seems to be generally believed that 
if the scientists would only look at these very dif- ficult social problems and not spend so 
much time fooling with less vital scientific ones, great success would come of it.

  It seems to me that we do think about these problems from time to time, but we don’t
  put a full-time effort into them – the reasons being that we know we don’t have any magic
  formula for solving social problems, that social problems are very much harder than scientific
  ones, and that we usually don’t get anywhere when we do think about them.
  
      I believe that a scientist looking at nonscientific problems is just as dumb 
      as the next guy - and when he talks about a nonscientific matter, he sounds as naive as
      anyone untrained in the matter. Since the question of the value of science is not a scientific 
      subject, this talk is dedicated to proving my point – by example.
